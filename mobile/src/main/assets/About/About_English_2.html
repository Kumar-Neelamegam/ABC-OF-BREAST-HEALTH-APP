<p>Breast Cancer is the most common cancer affecting women in India. In many parts of the Country, it is a 'taboo' - a 'closet' issue that is not openly discussed. Due to lack of awareness, more than 60% of breast cancers present in the advanced stages, with most succumbing within a year of being diagnosed.</p> 
<br/>
<p>Inspired by Shri Narendra Modi, our Hon'ble Prime Minister's dream of Digital India, Ushalakshmi Breast Cancer Foundation based out of Hyderabad has embarked upon making available information about every aspect of breast cancer and benign non cancer Breast health issues in simple easy to understand format on MOBILE APP  in TWELVE LANGUAGES (English, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Gujarati, Punjabi, Bengali, Marathi, Oriya & Assamese).</p>
<br/>
<p>I am very confident that this World's FIRST landmark initiative using Digital Media transcribed in all the commonly spoken languages would empower the Nation about various aspects of Breast Health, and equally, better prepare people to make informed decisions, thus filling a huge void in the delivery of Breast Health Care in our Country. </p>
