<p>Breast Cancer is the most common cancer affecting women in India. In many parts of the Country, it is a taboo – a ‘closet’ issue that is not openly discussed. Due to lack of awareness, more than 60% of Breast cancers present in advanced stages, with most succumbing within a year of being diagnosed. </p>

<br/>

<p>
Dr. Ushalakshmi is a daughter, sister, wife, my mother, grandmother, colleague, friend & a shocking statistic when she was diagnosed with early breast cancer in 2002. Being the only child for my parents, I was profoundly affected through my own personal experience of dealing with this illness diagnosed to someone so close to me. 
</p>

<br/>
<p>
To honour my mother’s struggle and applaud her strength in the fight against Breast Cancer, I founded Ushalakshmi Breast Cancer Foundation (UBF) in 2007. Over the past TEN years, the Foundation (which bears her name) has left no stone unturned in championing a one of its kind large scale breast cancer awareness drive across the Southern Indian States of Telangana & Andhra Pradesh through a number of innovative initiatives.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
Since 2007, in collaboration with Breast Cancer Care UK (largest Breast Healthcare provider in the United Kingdom), Ushalakshmi Breast Cancer Foundation has made available 100, 000 Booklets that has empowered people across the Telugu States about every aspect of Breast Cancer and Benign non-cancer Breast Health issues in simple easy to understand format in TWO languages (English & Telugu). 
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Inspired by Shri. Narendra Modi, Hon’ble Prime Minister of India’s dream of Digital India and encouraged by the enormous impact/ heightened levels of breast health awareness generated through these Information Booklets in the Telugu States, Ushalakshmi Breast Cancer Foundation has embarked upon making available this vital information on MOBILE APP that aims to reach out to people all over the Country in TWELVE languages 
(English, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Gujarati, Punjabi, Bengali, Marathi, Oriya & Assamese).

</p>
<br/>
<p>
In closing, I am very confident that this World's FIRST landmark initiative using Digital Media transcribed in all the commonly spoken Indian languages would empower the Nation about various aspects of Breast Health and better prepare people to make informed decisions, thus filling a huge void in the delivery of Breast Health Care in India.
