        <h2 class="h2" style="text-align:center;">Breast cancer <br />Exercises after surgery</h2>
    </div>
   
    
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The exercises are designed for use in the days and weeks after breast cancer surgery. They are suitable for most people.If there are any ongoing concerns about any pre existing arm or shoulder problems, a Specialist Consultation is required before commencing the exercises.</p>
    <div class="align">
   <p class="h2">INTRODUCTION</p>
   </div>
    <p class="question">Why exercise?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The exercises will help women and indeed men who have undergone breast cancer surgery to get back the range of arm movements that were present before surgery or radiotherapy. Exercise may also help tissue to heal, as during exercise more oxygen is supplied to the area being moved, and to relieve pain.</p>
    <p class="question">When should exercises be started?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Exercises should start as soon as possible after the operation &ndash; ideally the day after. One can gradually reintroduce everyday activities such as using the vacuum cleaner, hanging out washing or driving. The Exercises must be done within limits that are comfortable for the individual, and for short periods, to begin with</p>
    <p class="question">How long will the exercises need to be done?</p>
    <p>Muscles seize up very quickly if they are not used. Arm stiffness and tightness can occur long after surgery or radiotherapy so it is important to carry on doing these exercises as part of the daily routine.</p>
    
	  <div class="align">
   <p class="h2">Basic Exercises</p>
   </div>
   
    <p >Each exercise should be done three to five times to start with and gradually, when it feels right for the individual, increased to up to 10 times. Ideally, these exercises are started the day after Surgery</p>

    <font class="sub">Shoulder circling</font>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Use this exercise as a warm up. Sitting down, relax your hands in your lap, shrug your shoulders up towards your ears, then circle them back and down. Do this the same number of times both forwards and backwards</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Lie on your back with your hands behind your head and your elbows out to the sides. Gently push your elbows downwards as far as is comfortable.
