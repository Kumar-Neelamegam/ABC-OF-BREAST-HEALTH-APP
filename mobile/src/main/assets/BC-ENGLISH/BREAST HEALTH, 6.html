    <p class="story" style=" text-align: justify;">Radha (name changed), a 35 year old lady has been advised breast conserving Surgery for breast cancer. She fears that there would be a cosmetic defect after this type of surgery as a large chunk of breast tissue would be removed. She wondered if there were any technological advances that would help reshape her breast after breast conserving surgery</p>

    <p class="question">What is Oncoplastic breast conserving surgery?</p>

    <p>Oncoplastic breast surgery is one of the most interesting and challenging new developments evolved in the past 20 years. The aims of oncoplastic surgery are wide local excision of the cancer coupled with partial reconstruction of the defect in the breast to achieve a cosmetically acceptable result. Avoidance of mastectomy, consequent reduction of psychological morbidity and patient satisfaction are the principal goals in the development of various oncoplastic breast conserving techniques. Oncoplastic surgery allows large areas of the breast to be removed in carefully selected patients without the need for the patient to undergo a mastectomy.</p>
	
	
	 <p class="question">Is Breast reconstruction and Oncoplastic Breast conserving surgery one and the same?</p>
	
	

    <p>Oncoplastic breast conserving surgery should not be confused with Breast reconstruction done after mastectomy. Whereas it is possible for a surgeon to perform a mastectomy and then allow the plastic surgeon to carry out the reconstruction, this is not feasible in oncoplastic breast conservative surgery, as it requires knowledge both of oncological and plastic surgery combined in one person for a good oncological and cosmetic outcome.</p>
	
	
	<h2 class="h2" style="text-align:center;">Oncoplastic breast surgery - The Basics</h2>
	
	<ul>
        <li>
            Many women chose mastectomy over breast conserving surgery fearing the risk of recurrence. It is now well known from various trials over the past two decades that mastectomy and breast conserving surgery are on an equal plane in terms of survival. However the Surgeon must be skilled enough to ensure that local recurrence after breast conserving surgery are kept low (about 1% per annum). This can be achieved by excising the lesion with a clear normal margin all round the cancer. If the surgeon leaves cancer tissue behind or if the excision margin still contains cancer tissue in it, there is a high risk of local recurrence after surgery.  
        </li>
		<br/>
		
		 <li>
		 The concept of the Oncoplastic Breast surgeon is a new one that requires the combination of knowledge in thee different specialties: Surgical Oncology, Plastic surgery and Breast Radiology. Oncoplastic Breast conserving Surgery is an innovative and sophisticated subspecialty within Breast Surgery & is an essential skill for the dedicated Breast Specialist. 
		  </li>
		<br/>  
		   <li>
		   The indications for cosmetically acceptable breast conserving surgery can be safely extended to cancers involving all the quadrants of the breast in carefully selected patients, thus expanding the armamentarium of Oncoplastic Surgery.
		    </li>
		
    </ul>
	
	
	<font class="sub">Conclusion</font>
 <p>In this era of Oncoplastic Breast Surgery, it would be unreasonable to remove a breast lesion with subsequent deformity. There is clearly a growing demand for cosmetically acceptable breast conserving surgery the world over. In this day and age, Breast cancer surgery must be carried out with due consideration to cosmetic outcome without oncological compromise as disfiguring and mutilating excisions are neither justified nor acceptable  </p>
