<p class="story">Priya (name changed), a 28 year old lady noticed a freely mobile lump in her right breast.</p>
<p class="question">What is a Fibroadenoma?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The breasts are made up of ducts (tubes that carry milk to the nipple) and lobules (milk-producing glands), which are surrounded by fatty tissue and supportive tissue. Sometimes tissue will grow over a lobule like a ball, forming a solid lump. This is a Fibroadenoma. It is one of the commonest benign (non cancerous lumps) in the breast</p>

<p  class="question">What causes Fibroadenoma?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is thought that they occur because of increased sensitivity to the female hormone oestrogen.&nbsp;</p>
<p  class="question">What are the types of Fibroadenoma?</p>
<font class="sub">Simple fibroadenoma</font>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most fibroadenomas are about 1&ndash;3cm in size and are called simple fibroadenomas. Simple fibroadenomas don&rsquo;t increase the risk of developing breast cancer in the future.</p>
<font class="sub">Complex fibroadenoma</font>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some fibroadenomas are called complex fibroadenomas. Having a complex fibroadenoma can very slightly increase the risk of developing breast cancer in the future.</p>
<font class="sub">Giant or juvenile fibroadenoma</font>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Occasionally, a fibroadenoma can grow to more than 5cm and may be called a giant fibroadenoma. Those found in teenage girls may be called juvenile fibroadenomas.&nbsp;</p>
<p  class="question">Is it benign (non malignant)?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The vast majority of Fibroadenomas are benign (non-cancerous) and do not increase the risk of developing breast cancer. There is a very small risk for Complex fibroadenomas to turn malignant.&nbsp;</p>
<p  class="question">How does a Fibroadenoma feel and at what age does it commonly occur?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Fibroadenoma usually has a rubbery texture, is smooth to the touch and moves easily under the skin. For this reason it is sometimes called a &lsquo;breast mouse&rsquo;. Fibroadenomas are usually painless.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fibroadenomas are very common and it is not unusual to have more than one. They often develop during puberty and so are mostly found in young women, although they can occur in women of any age. Most fibroadenomas are about 1 to 3cm in size and are called common fibroadenomas. Some can grow to more than 5cms and are called Giant fibroadenomas. Fibroadenomas found in teenage girls are called juvenile fibroadenomas.&nbsp;</p>
<p  class="question">Does a Fibroadenoma grow if left untreated?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most fibroadenomas stay the same size. A small number of fibroadenomas get bigger. Fibroadenomas can also get bigger during pregnancy and breastfeeding. This is quite normal and nothing to worry about.&nbsp;</p>
<p  class="question">How is a Fibroadenoma diagnosed?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Fibroadenoma usually become noticeable as a lump in the breast. A Specialist Consultation is essential and it is important to undergo three different tests, often referred to as Triple assessment, so that a definite diagnosis can be made. These are a clinical breast examination, a mammogram (breast x-ray) and ultrasound scan (which creates a picture of the breast using high-frequency sound waves) and a needle core biopsy of the lump under the guidance of an ultrasound.&nbsp;</p>

<p  class="question">What is involved in doing a needle test and is FNAC the same as Core biopsy?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two ways of doing a needle test. The first is Fine Needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). A FNAC is where a fine needle and syringe is used to take a sample of cells from the lump.&nbsp;</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center">Most Specialist Centres across the world are now doing core needle biopsy rather than a FNAC. A core biopsy uses a larger needle to take a small sample of tissue under local anesthesia from the lump rather than just cells. This is more reliable &amp; accurate&nbsp; in making&nbsp; a diagnosis.&nbsp;</p>

<p  class="question">How is a Fibroadenoma managed?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the Triple assessment including a Core biopsy as mentioned above has confirmed the presence of a Fibroadenoma, the lady can be reassured that the lump is not a cancer and that it will not lead to a cancer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the size of the Fibroadenoma is small less than 2cms, it can be left alone and followed up with an Ultrasound scan in two to three months to make sure it has not got bigger. If the size has not changed, the patient can be discharged from follow up. Some women do not like to keep the lump, in which case the lump can be excised.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the lump gets bigger, painful, or the lump is over 3 cms or if it is proven to be complex fibroadenoma on core needle biopsy, surgery is advisable to remove the Fibroadenoma. The operation is done under a general anaesthetic, and the patient would need to be in hospital for the day or overnight.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With advances in surgical techniques (Oncoplastic breast surgery), this operation can be done by placing as incision at the edge of the areoa (circumareolar incision) to give a good cosmetic result with a scar that is least visible and would fade in time. There should not be any defect in the breast after the surgery ensuring a good aesthetic outcome.&nbsp;</p>
