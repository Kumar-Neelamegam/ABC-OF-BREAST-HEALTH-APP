   <p class="question">What is a phyllodes tumour?</p>

<p>A phyllodes tumour is a hard lump of tissue that can appear in the supportive tissue (stroma) of the breast. It&rsquo;s thought that it develops naturally as the breast ages and changes.</p>
<p>Once formed a phyllodes tumour may grow quite quickly and quite large. Sometimes this can cause the skin over the area to look red (inflamed).</p>
<p>Although they can affect a woman at any time in her life, phyllodes tumours are most common in women between 40 and 50 who haven&rsquo;t yet been through the menopause. It&rsquo;s unlikely that more than one will develop at a time, though it is possible.</p>
<p>Phyllodes tumours are not common and are usually benign (not cancer). However, they can sometimes be malignant (cancer). They are grouped into three types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benign</li>
<li>Borderline malignant</li>
<li>Malignant</li>
</ul>
<p>A benign phyllodes tumour can come back after it has been removed, although this is unusual. In very rare cases it may become borderline malignant or malignant.</p>

  <p class="question">How is benign Phylloides tumour diagnosed?</p>
 
<p>A phyllodes tumour usually becomes noticeable as a quick-growing lump in the breast. A Triple assessment is required &ndash; Clinical Breast Examination, Bilateral Mammogram &amp; Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy.</p>


<p>Benign phyllodes tumours can be difficult to diagnose because they can be confused with other breast problems, such as a fibroadenoma. Sometimes, an operation may be needed to remove the lump to get a definite diagnosis.

<p>Phyllodes tumours are always treated with surgery. The Specialist should discuss the type of surgery needed.</p>

<p>The aim of the surgery is to remove the entire tumour with a margin (border) of normal breast tissue around it. It&rsquo;s important to have a <strong>clear margin</strong> of healthy tissue when the lump is removed, as this reduces the risk of the tumour coming back. If a clear margin is not achieved by the initial surgery further surgery is usually recommended.</p>

		 <hr>

<p>If the tumour is very large occupying a significant proportion of the breast, then a mastectomy is recommended.</p>
 
   <p class="question">Is there a possibility for these tumours to come back?</p>
  
<p>In most cases, benign phyllodes tumour is successfully treated by surgery. But sometimes the tumour can recur in the breast (known as local recurrence). If this happens, more surgery will usually be offered.</p>
